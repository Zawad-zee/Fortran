Step-by-Step Guide: Fortran (gfortran) Installation on Windows 11 via MSYS2

Phase 1: Download and Install MSYS2

Download the MSYS2 Installer:

Go to the official MSYS2 website: https://www.msys2.org/
Look for the "Download" section and click on the msys2-x86_64-*.exe installer link. Download this file.
Run the MSYS2 Installer:

Locate the downloaded .exe file and run it.


Open MSYS2 MSYS Terminal as Administrator always:

Go to your Start Menu.
Find the "MSYS2" folder.
Click on the shortcut named "MSYS2 MSYS". This opens a Bash terminal window.
Update the Core Packages:

In the MSYS2 MSYS terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
Bash

pacman -Syu

This command updates the package database and upgrades the core system packages. Repeat the step couple of times to make sure it is upto date

Phase 3: Install the MinGW-w64 Fortran 
Open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit Terminal as Administrator:
Click on the shortcut named "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit".
Install the Fortran Compiler Package:

In the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal, type the following command and press Enter:

pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran

Phase 4: Verify Installation

Check gfortran Version:
While still in the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal, type:

gfortran --version
You should see output similar to this (version numbers might differ):
GNU Fortran (MinGW-W64 x86_64-posix-seh, built by GCC revision ...) 12.2.0
